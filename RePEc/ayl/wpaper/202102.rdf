Title:  Mobile Applications Leveraged in the COVID-19 Pandemic in East and South-East Asia: A Review and Content Analysis
Abstract:  world.
Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased attention to digital tools to support governmental public health policies in East and 
South-East Asia. Mobile applications (or apps) related to COVID-19 continue to emerge and evolve with a wide variety of 
characteristics and functions. However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating such apps, with most of the available studies 
conducted in the early days of the pandemic. This study aimed to examine free apps developed or supported by governments in the 
East and South-East Asian regions and highlight their key characteristics and functions. Also, we aimed to interpret how other 
COVID-19 policies were associated with the introduction of these apps. We systematically searched for apps in the Apple App Store 
and the Google Play Store and analysed the contents of eligible apps. We included the mobile apps released or updated between 1 
March 2020 and 7 May 2021 in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and 
the Philippines. The CoronaNet Research Project database was also used to examine the timeline of public health policy commencement 
dates to the release dates of the included apps. Of the 1,943 mobile apps initially identified, 46 were eligible, with almost 70% of
the mobile apps being intended for the general public. The most common function was health monitoring, followed by raising public health 
awareness through education and information dissemination. Significantly, most apps for quarantine monitoring were mandatory for the target
users or a population subset. Most mobile apps emerged close to the public health policy commencement dates in the early stages of the pandemic. 
Mobile apps with functions related to COVID-19 vaccines began to appear parallel to vaccination rollout. In East and South-East Asia, most governments 
employed mobile health apps as adjuncts to public health measures in this pandemic for tracking COVID-19 cases and delivering credible information.
